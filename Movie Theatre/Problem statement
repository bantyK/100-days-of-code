The problem that I am trying to solve in this project:


3 shows are running in a movie theatre. You are given available seats of all shows. Seats are
categorised as Platinum, Gold and Silver. Show all available seats to customers before letting them
select seats. A, B & C rows are categorised into Platinum, Gold and Silver and costs Rs. 320, Rs. 280 &
Rs. 240 respectively.
Customers who want to book the tickets first ask the show no. and then check whether seats are
available or not if available then book their seats else ask them to enter seats again.
Before each booking print all available seats and after booking show the total cost including taxes.
All bookings would be charged service tax of 14% along with Swachh Bharat Cess and Krishi Kalyan
Cess at a rate of 0.5% each.
Finally print total revenue generated along with above taxes payable by theatre owner in following
format:
Revenue: Rs. xxxx
Service Tax: Rs. xxxx
Swachh Bharat Cess: Rs. xxxx
Krishi Kalyan Cess: Rs. xxxx
